### 🧠 Purpose

This server powers the unified backend for both the Virtual Medical Mission, Roosevelt Connect, Intelligrader platforms, bridging healthcare and education into a single digital ecosystem.

Through Virtual Medical Mission, it delivers accessible global healthcare with a custom-built EMR and eVisit system.

Through Roosevelt Connect, it supports students’ daily academic needs: schedules, coursework, communications, and campus resources — all seamlessly integrated into one app.

Through Intelligrader, it supports the AI cloud infrastructure to allow models and students collaborate on AP FRQ practice.

Together, they form a connected infrastructure that empowers both well-being and learning, ensuring every student and patient can access the care and support they need, anywhere in the world.
